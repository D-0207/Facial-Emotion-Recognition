Emotion detection using deep neural networks is currently considered one of the most challenging research tasks. In comparison to traditional methods like physiological signals recognition, speech signals variation, and text semantics, deep learning-based image segmentation demonstrates superior performance.

This paper introduces a few-shot learning system designed using Siamese networks and a triplet loss function. The proposed system's effectiveness is evaluated using the FER-2013 dataset.

By leveraging Siamese networks and employing a suitable pairing strategy within the training batches, the proposed system effectively captures distinguishing features among images. The Siamese network facilitates the computation of input similarities by comparing their corresponding feature vectors.
