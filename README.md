Emotion Detection using deep neural networks is one of the most challenging research tasks at present. Deep Learning-based image segmentation shows better performance than traditional emotion detection methods like physiological signals recognition, speech signals variation and text semantics. This paper presents the design of a few shot learning system using Siamese networks and triplet loss function. The performance of this proposed system is assessed using the FER-2013 dataset.
Using Siamese networks helps obtain the features that set apart the images using a proper pairing strategy in taking advantage of the training batches. The Siamese network is able to compute the similarity of the inputs by comparing their feature vectors.
